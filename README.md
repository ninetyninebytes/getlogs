# getlogs
### a simple way to get journalctl logs, and export them to a .log or .txt file

## Features
- exports journalctl logs to a .log or .txt file
- saves all of the files in your home folder, in an organized manner
	 - if the directory does not exist, it will build one for you
- the script will notify you if you're using it as root

## Instructions
1. cd into the directory where the file is located
	- example: `cd ~/Downloads`
2. set executable permissions for the script
	- example: `chmod +x getlogs.sh`
3. run the script! (without root)
	- example: `./getlogs.sh`

## Coming Soon
- time range features
- root account support
